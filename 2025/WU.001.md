# Diver OSINT CTF 2025

### In this Japanese based CTF, team SE4L placed 15th out of 668 teams. The two challenges below were just two of a few that I solved with ``P2T`` being one of the harder ones to solve for non-Japanese speaking teams (like us). Below showcases my steps and findings along the way. Enjoy.


## ``P2T``
### Challenge Descripton:
``The photo posted to the left of this photo shows an animal. Answer its name as it is written in Japanese.-- Flag Format: Diver25{シバイヌ}``

### Steps to Flag:

Instantly I noticed a few things that stuck out about this image (see below) - 
  1. The gold 'x' that can be seen in the laminated paper stood out as either a unique light design or some type of display.
  2. The white 'c' shape which I believed to be another light source, like something circular or a window.
  3. The Japanese text on the right - this stood to be a problem in particular for non-Japanese speaking teams since each translation websites interpreted this text differently, but all had a similar theme of 'mountains, goats, lions, peace, roar, silence'.
  4. Finally, the laminated sheet itself looked amateur at best. My first thought with this was that it was either a school project or some community display at like a park or some location similar.

Moving on with these new ideas in my head, I kept trying to find a more solidified translation and this was when my teammates shared that they found one that provided the answer ``Mt. Tateyama`` from the text ``立山`` in the image. -- This find was very important as without it,
we would have been stuck without a next step. This also confirmed my idea that this would be located a park of some sorts, so I jumped to Google Maps and searched for any campsite building or a community center.

I ended up locating the ``Mount Tateyama Visitor Center`` which ended up confirming a lot of details.

I quickly jumped into some of the photospheres that were inside of the building, in hopes to find some confirming facts, which ended up being the case. (see images below)

Incomplete.
